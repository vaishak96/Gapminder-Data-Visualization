# Gapminder Data Visualization

This project is a data visualization tool inspired by Hans Rosling's Gapminder. It visualizes global trends in life expectancy and income, highlighting key historical events and their impact on global health and wealth through interactive charts.

## Project Overview

This website is a data visualization project inspired by Hans Rosling's Gapminder. It visualizes global trends in life expectancy and income, highlighting key historical events and their impact on global health and wealth.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Ensures styling and responsiveness with Bootstrap 4.4.1 and custom CSS.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, utilizing D3.js for data-driven visualizations and jQuery for DOM manipulation.
- **External Libraries**: Incorporates Popper.js and Bootstrap's JavaScript components for enhanced functionality.
- **JSON Data**: Retrieves dynamic data for visualization.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Legend**: Includes a color-coded legend to differentiate between continents, enhancing the clarity of data presentation.

## Visualization Details

- Uses D3.js to create scalable vector graphics (SVG) for plotting data points.
- Implements logarithmic scaling for the x-axis (GDP per capita) and linear scaling for the y-axis (life expectancy).
- Animated transitions provide a dynamic and engaging way to visualize changes over time.

## User Interface

- A clean and minimalistic design with a navigation bar that includes the project logo and title.
- Centralized project description and technologies used section to inform users about the website's purpose and implementation.
